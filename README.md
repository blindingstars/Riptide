# Riptide

Riptide is a colorful and dark theme for Textual IRC.

Riptide is based on [emilyst/Eighties-Aligned](https://github.com/emilyst/Eighties-Aligned), "a Textual 5 style which derives elements of its appearance from the 'Tomorrow Night Eighties' the 'Nox' themes included with the Textual IRC client." The color scheme is borrowed (with love) from [voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme](https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme) and also includes a few favorites from [base16](https://chriskempson.github.io/base16/).

Nick, timestamp, and font preferences are all respected; this theme will not override them.

For ease of customization, this theme uses Sass. The compiled CSS file is included for ease of use, but if you want to remix this in any way, I encourage you to edit `design.scss` and watch for changes with the compiler of your choice (I used compass and the `config.rb` is included).

Screenshots coming soon!
